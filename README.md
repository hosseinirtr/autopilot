# End-to-End Autonomous Driving Project

This project is a contribution to a PhD thesis on end-to-end autonomous driving at New York University. The goal of the project is to develop a system that can drive a vehicle without human intervention, using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Phase One: Finding Lines in Video

In this phase, we process a video as input and convert it to grayscale. From the grayscale image, we extract a matrix of important (x,y) coordinates of lines and add those lines to the image. We perform this process frame by frame for the entire video.
